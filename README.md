# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview

This project is a classification task that aims to classify Iris flowers into three different species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. The classification is performed using three different machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 Iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of the three species.

### Data Source

The Iris dataset is commonly included in machine learning libraries, and it can also be obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

## Algorithms

### 1. Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective classification algorithm. In this project, it is utilized to classify Iris flowers based on their features.

### 2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Support Vector Machine is a powerful algorithm for classification tasks. It seeks to find the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes. SVM is applied here to classify the Iris flowers.

### 3. Decision Tree

A Decision Tree is a versatile algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, a Decision Tree is constructed to classify Iris flowers based on their feature attributes.
